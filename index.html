    <h1>Getting to understand the basics of HTML!!</h1>
    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the basic building block of all websites. It is used to create and organize the content on a web page, such as text, images, links, and headings. 
        Think of HTML like the structure of a house — it builds the walls, windows, and doors, while other tools like CSS and JavaScript add style and movement.
         Learning HTML is the first step in web development because it helps you understand how websites are made and how different parts of a page fit together.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Why HTML is important?</h2>
    <p>HTML is important because it tells the web browser what to show and how to show it. Without HTML, a web page would have no structure or meaning. It helps organize content so that people can read it easily. It also helps 
        search engines understand what the page is about, which is good for getting found online.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Getting Started with HTML</h3>
    <p>Starting with HTML is easy. All you need is a simple text editor like VS and a web browser like Chrome.
         You write your code in the text editor using HTML tags, then open the file in the browser to see how it looks. As you learn more,
          you can create your own web pages with text, images, and links.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Basic HTML tags</h4>
    <p>Here are some HTML tags you can start with!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>h - For headings</li>
        <li>p - For paragraphs</li>
        <li>img - For inserting images</li>
        <li>li - For listing</li>
        <li>a - For links</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>HTML is the first step to creating your own website. It helps you build the structure and content of your page. 
        By learning HTML, you open the door to web development and many exciting things you can create online. Keep practicing, and you’ll get better with time!</p>
